Problem \#1
-----------

#### Data Import and Cleaning

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)

brfss = p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(state = locationabbr, 
         county = locationdesc) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  arrange(year, state, county) %>% 
  mutate(response = as.factor(response)) %>% 
  select(year, state, county, response, sample_size)
```

#### Questions and Responses

-   In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?
    -   In 2002, 3 states were observed at 7 locations: Connecticut, Florida, and North Carolina.

``` r
 brfss %>% 
  filter(year == "2002") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(n_counties = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  filter(n_counties == 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   state n_counties
    ##   <chr>      <int>
    ## 1 CT             7
    ## 2 FL             7
    ## 3 NC             7

-   Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of observations in each state from 2002 to 2010.
    -   This plot is horrifying. I removed the legend, as trying to determine which line represents which individual state is anxiety inducing. Overall, I would say that this plot shows that for most states, the total number of observations has remained fairly constant over time, with a few states having very large variability.

``` r
brfss %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>% 
  summarize(obs_state = sum(sample_size)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = obs_state, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Total Observations",
    x = "Year",
    y = "No. of Observations",
    caption = "Data from the BRFSS, p8105 datasets package") +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

-   Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.
    -   *Response*
-   For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.
    -   *Response*
